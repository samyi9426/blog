## [Code Signing - Support - Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/)

Code signing your app **assures users that it's from a known source and hasn't been modified since it was last signed**. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple.
